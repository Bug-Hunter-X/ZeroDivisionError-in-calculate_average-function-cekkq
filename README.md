This repository contains a Python function `calculate_average` that calculates the average of a list of numbers.  The original version had a potential `ZeroDivisionError` if an empty list was provided as input. The improved version includes a check to handle this edge case gracefully, returning 0 for empty input lists.  The `bug.py` file demonstrates the original error, while `bugSolution.py` presents the corrected code.
